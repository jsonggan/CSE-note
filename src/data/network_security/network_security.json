    "Security Properties": "1. **Confidentiality**: only Sender and Receiver should understand the content of the message \n2. **Integrity**: sender and receriver need to make sure that the content is not changed \n3. **Authentication**: sender and receiver can confirm the identity of each other \n4. **Access and Availability**: internet service must be available to users",
    "Security Attack": "1. Confidentiality <----- **Eavesdrop** \n2. Integrity <----- **Alter messages**, insert message into connection \n3. Authentication <----- **Impersonate**, spoof source address in packet. **Hijack**, take over ongoing connection by removing either sender or receriver. \n4. Access and Availability <----- **Denial of service**, prevent service from bring used by others",
    "Cryptography": "**Substitution Cipher**: It just map a set of letters to another set, it's very easy to deciphered! \n\n**Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Mean we use same key to encrypt and decrypt.\n**Data Encryption Standard (DES)**: Can brute force to decrypt\n**Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: Need 1 billion billion year on supercomputer!!!!\n\n**Asymmetirc Key Cryptography**: Public private key.\nencrypt using public key and decript using private key, signing using private key and verify using public key",
    "RSA Math": "1. Choose two large prime numbers: p, q \n2. Compute: n = pq, z = (q-1) * (p-1)\n3. Choose e where e < n, and e, z are relatvely prime to one another\n4. Choose d where (ed-1)modz = 0\n5. The **public key** is *n, e)\n6. The **private key** is (n, d)\n\npublic key: c = m^e(mod n)\nprivate key: m = c^d(mod n)"
